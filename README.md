Predicting whether a mushroom is safe to eat
Wanting to gain more experience with neural nets, I came across a dataset on Kaggle consisting of poisonous and edibile mushrooms along with their physical characteristics like odor and shape. More information can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification.
Included in the notebook are two classification methods: artificial neural networks and decision trees. I included the decision tree as it seemed to be the most obvious approach.
TL;DR conclusion: both classification models were excellent. The logloss for the neural net was minimal and the accuracy scores for both were near-perfect.
